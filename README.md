# Banking-Transactions-Analysis
## Introduction
In this project, I took on the role of a bank data analyst, analyzing a comprehensive banking dataset that simulates internal transaction data used by financial institutions to understand customer behaviour, optimize services, and inform strategic planning.
The dataset contains 20,000 enriched financial transactions across products like checking accounts, loans, mortgages, and card payments. 
This analysis will help the bank:
•	Understand how different customer segments behave financially
•	Identify high-fee and high-risk patterns for cost control and opportunity
•	Evaluate operational efficiency by channel and region
•	Develop data-driven strategies to boost engagement and retention
